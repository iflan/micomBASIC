# micomBASIC (マイコン BASIC) programs for the Apple II

This is a collection of type-in programs found in the Japanese
computer magazine [_micomBASIC (マイコン BASIC)_] from the '80s and
'90s.  These programs were typed in by @eientei from the applesaucefdc
Discord server.  I have put them here with explanations of how they
work.

## Programs

The list of Apple II programs so far:

*   [The Octopus](octopus) by Shinji Minamiyama (南山 真爾), 1985.
*   [The Active Balls](active_balls) by Shinji Minamiyama (南山 真爾),
    1986.

There are several other sources of _micomBASIC_ information, including:

    of the available programs by system type.  From this list, there
    are only seven Apple II type-in programs.

    issues from December 1984 to December 1994.

    in each issue. Unfortunately, _finding_ the programs is much more
    difficult.

## Why?

I got into this because @eientei asked for help figuring out why their
type-in of [Graphic Maze](graphic_maze) wasn't working.  I looked at
the assembly language and made some "educated" guesses about what was
going on.  It turned out that those guesses weren't exactly right, but
they got me interested in figuring out how the program worked.  I've
always been intrigued by maze-generating programs.

Later, @eientei mentioned [The Active Balls](active_balls), so I
started disassembling that.  In the process I found the "hidden"
sprite of the octopus, which led to [The Octopus](octopus).

Now I'm so far down the rabbit hole, I might as well finish. :-)

I'd really like to know if the authors of these programs are still
around and active.
